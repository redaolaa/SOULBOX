Copy this into Gemini (after uploading your Excel/CSV and the spec):

---
Convert my attached Programming Sheet (Excel or CSV) into the exact import format required by the SOULBOX app.

Use the full specification in the attached GEMINI_TEMPLATE_SPEC.md. In particular:

1. Output a single CSV with this exact header row:
   weekStartDate,dayOfWeek,dayType,station,phase,slot,exerciseName,focus,isStatic,staticCondition

2. One data row per exercise. 72 rows per week (6 days × 12 exercises per day). Use the day → dayType and focus table from the spec; do not guess.

3. For Monday, Wednesday, and Saturday Station 3 only: set exerciseName = "Nonstop sparring", isStatic = TRUE, and staticCondition = technique-station3 or conditioning-station3 as specified. Output 3 rows (slots A, B, C) for each.

4. For any empty cell in my sheet, use exerciseName = [FILL].

5. weekStartDate must be the Sunday of that week (e.g. 2026-01-04). I will tell you the week number or date if needed.

Give me the resulting CSV (paste the contents or provide a downloadable file).
